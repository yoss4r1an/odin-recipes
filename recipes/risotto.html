      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This creamy Instant Pot risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese will seem like a dish ordered at a restaurant instead of made at home.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cups diced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>¾ cup white wine</li>
            <li>1 quart chicken stock</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Add butter and olive oil; stir until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add rosemary sprig; cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir rice into the pot until each grain is coated with butter and olive oil mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in chicken stock, stirring to scrape the sides of the pot. Simmer for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Turn the venting knob to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Tap venting knob a few times with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stand back; turn knob to point at vent. Remove lid when pressure is released, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir risotto until creamy, about 1 minute. Discard rosemary sprig. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
